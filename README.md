# Capstone
This is a final product created by me while I was part of a University "front-end" web development course.
This is a 3 page webpage, with Html, css, and JS created from scratch by myself. 
The first page (the home page) contains 3 columns (each with their own custom scrollbar): News, Pictures, and About Me.
There is also a constant navigation bar at the top of the page and a static footer. 
The second page incorporates Nth-Child operator in a table, a Google Maps API, and various other advanced web development attribtutes.
The final page is a simple picture of a car and inline with it is a short description of its specifications.
This was my first fully developed site, at age 14.
